A Tetris clone developed purely in the React JavaScript framework. Made following a great YouTube tutorial by [Weibenfalk](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0jpcQ5lO0nEH2BpPmJhePz_urgyAljFB) for practice and learning. Currently the code is verbatim from the tutorial, but I intend to play around with it once finished.

This project utilizes [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics).


This README is a WIP.
